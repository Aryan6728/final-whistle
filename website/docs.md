# Final Whistle — Technical Documentation

**Track:** Prediction Markets and Settlement — TxODDS World Cup Hackathon (Superteam Earn), also submitted to the Superteam India Buildathon.

## Core idea

Final Whistle is a Solana prediction market where settlement isn't decided by a person or a committee. The moment TxLINE anchors a signed proof of a match outcome on-chain, the program calls directly into TxLINE's `validate_stat` instruction and settles the market in the same transaction. There is no resolver, no dispute window, and no external oracle trust assumption — trust flows from TxLINE's own on-chain verified state via a Cross-Program Invocation (CPI).

## Problem it solves

Most prediction markets settle in one of two broken ways: a centralized backend marks the result manually, or a committee-based oracle runs a multi-day dispute window. Both are impractical for fast-moving, granular sports markets, and both leave a trust gap between the person who staked and the person who decides they won. Final Whistle removes that gap by making settlement a deterministic, permissionless on-chain instruction instead of a human decision.

## MVP scope

Two market types for this build:
- Match Winner
- Total Goals Over/Under 2.5

Scoped down intentionally from a larger market catalog to ship a working, deployed build within the hackathon window rather than a wider but incomplete one.

## Architecture

### On-chain program (Anchor)
- **Accounts:** `Market` (fixture, market type, criteria, pool total, status), `Vault` (PDA-controlled escrow), `StakePosition` (per-user stake and side)
- **Instructions:**
  - `initialize_market` — creates a market for a fixture
  - `stake` — locks SOL/USDC into the vault, records a position
  - `settle_market` — CPIs into TxLINE's `validate_stat` instruction with a signed Merkle proof, reads the confirmed stat, matches it against market criteria, marks the market settled
  - `claim_payout` — winning side withdraws its share of the vault

### Off-chain keeper
A small, permissionless script that polls TxLINE's score stream for tracked fixtures. When a match ends, it fetches the signed Merkle proof from TxLINE's Validation Proofs endpoint and calls `settle_market`. Anyone can run this — it isn't a trusted party, just a convenience trigger.

### Frontend
Next.js with a Solana wallet adapter.

## TxLINE endpoints used

- `POST /auth/guest/start` — guest JWT for API access
- `POST /api/token/activate` — API token activation after the on-chain `subscribe` transaction
- Fixtures endpoint — match metadata for the World Cup schedule
- Scores stream (SSE) — live match events used by the keeper
- Validation Proofs endpoint — signed Merkle proof consumed by `settle_market`'s CPI into `validate_stat`

## Tech stack

Anchor · Solana (devnet) · TxLINE World Cup free tier (service level 1 or 12) · Next.js · Solana wallet adapter · a lightweight Node keeper script.

## Compliance notes

- No TxL token is used for staking, wagering, or peer-to-peer transfer — stakes are held in SOL/USDC, as required by the track rules.
- Settlement is a genuine CPI into TxLINE's on-chain `validate_stat` instruction, not a re-implemented signature check — this follows the track's encouraged "Custom On-Chain Settlement Engine" pattern.
